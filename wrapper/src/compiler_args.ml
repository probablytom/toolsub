(* FIXME: this function should be unwrapped into arg-processing and cpp-invoking parts.
 * We really do a few separate things:
 * - filter out cilpp arguments (-save-temps, -driver, -plugin, -pass)
 * - chunk arguments according to meaning (... "-o", file... -> ... ["-o", file] ... 
 * - rewrite them as needed for our redirection and simulation of -MD
 *      (simulation of -MD is a side-effect of always passing -o,
 *      which changes the meaning of -MD -- see below)
 *
 * Probably the right factoring is functions which do the following
 *  - scan and chunk args, outputting a record of 'interesting information'
 *  - filter out cilpp's arguments  (this one can go in cilpp... or does our "-driver" hack
 *          generalise beyond cilpp? yes -- it's how we know how to invoke the preprocessor;
 *          any preprocessor tap or filter needs this)
 *  - rewrite to divert to a temporary file
