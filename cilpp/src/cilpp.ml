(* First we preprocess into a temporary file;
 * we pass through to cpp all our arguments except for any following "-o".
 * Then we run CIL and output to the intended -o file.
 *
 * We have an identity crisis. Do we emulate 'cpp' or 'cc -E'?
 * Although the former sounds right, the latter is better for wrapper scripts
 * in many cases, because they may not know which 'cpp' command to run, but
 * can usually figure out the driver (albeit from parent-PID hackery
 * or from an explicit -driver option or CC_DRIVER variable or...).
 * It may be significant also that GNU 'make' defaults CPP to '$(CC) -E'.
 * However, guessing the driver is always a hack too (using parent PID).
 *
 * Can we "do both"? In short, yes. We have to pick a thing to run and run it, to do the
 * preprocessing. But do we need to know *how* to invoke it? Not really. The caller tells us,
 * by the arguments they pass! Whereas we used to accept -driver, now we accept -real-cpp.
 * It can be "cpp" or "$driver -E" or anything else.
 *
 * Our wrapper script will always use "$driver -E" as the -real-cpp, but as cilpp we don't
 * care. We do need to get our own options; to be safe we stop scanning at the first option
 * we don't understand (or '--'). But we can also use the CC_IDENTIFY_ARGS feature of the
 * wrapper script: if it sets CC_IDENTIFIED_ARGS, it can tell us where to find our args at 
 * any point in the command line.
